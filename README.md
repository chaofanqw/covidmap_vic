# Covid-19 Cases Map (Victoria)

## Intro
~~This map is an interative map for COVID-19 cases in Victoria (divided by city councils). [data source: https://covidlive.com.au/] 

~~For visiting the website, github page is available through https://chaofanqw.github.io/covidmap_vic/

~~If possible, I will try to update info on time. _(:з」∠)_

Because the Victoria Government has provided the visualization map since 24/08/2020, this project is deprecated.
